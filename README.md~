# Shelf: A Prototype-Based Object System for Guile

## What is it?

Shelf is a lightweight implementation of prototypes for Guile
Scheme. 

## What does it do?

Shelf lets you define simple objects containing key/value pairs. These
objects can use another object as a *prototype*. Objects have all the
properties of their prototype, plus whatever key/value pairs they
choose to add or override.

Shelf lets you create methods as object properties with familiar
'this' and 'super' bindings. Think Javascript but cleaner and backed
by the power of Scheme.

Saving and loading with Shelf is easy---Shelf objects can be written
out as Scheme syntax and then run back into the interpreter.

Shelf also lets you compile your objects to object code and then back
to Scheme whenever you like.
